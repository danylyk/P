              <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
              <p>Meditation is the practice of training your mind which comes with thousands of years of history. Throughout the years, it has incorporated not only the teachings of new sages, but also the knowledge of modern science.  Nowadays, meditation is a collaboration between centuries-old wisdom and modern scientific knowledge!</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <p><br>
                Even though it is a way of training your mind, meditation affects not only your mind, but your whole life.  It improves sleep, reduces stress and anxiety, and helps with concentration.  Furthermore, it helps you to fully enjoy your life--to both be yourself and accept others as they are.  In the end, meditation helps us to be mindful.<br>
                <br>
                And the great news is that you don’t have to be a guru in anything to start meditating.  With a little guidance, you’ll be able to cultivate mindfulness while enjoying your practice!</p>

              <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
              <p>Have you ever noticed yourself living on autopilot? Days and weeks passing by where you’re so caught up in your everyday life that you notice nearly nothing?  We’ve all been there from time to time, but our life doesn’t have to be like that and mindfulness is one of the ways out.</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <p><br>
                During meditation, we learn to pay attention to what is happening here and now.  We learn to notice our breathing, the sensations in our body, our emotions and feelings.  Furthermore, we learn to notice the world and people around us.  These thing all combine to help us become more mindful.<br>
                <br>
                When you become more mindful, you gain the ability to regulate your attention in order to keep focused on your present experience.  Once you’re in charge of your attention, you can enjoy and live each moment of your life.  In addition, mindfulness opens the possibility to approach your experiences with curiosity, openness, and acceptance, regardless of their intensity or desirability.  In the end, it helps you get to know yourself better: to accept both yourself and the world around you. </p>

              <h2>How should I breathe during meditation?</h2>
              <p>You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t thought to themselves: “How should I breathe during meditation? Is there a “right” way?”<br>
              <br>
              Breathing is one of the foundations of meditation, so it’s no wonder we want to practice it the right way. When we breathe during meditation, the key is to allow your body to breathe completely naturally, exactly as it wants to.</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <h3>What does that mean?</h3>
                <p>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can inhale and exhale through your nose or your mouth, whichever you prefer.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on your breath and observe its natural flow. Notice the sensation of your breath flowing through your body.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't try to breathe in a specific way; there’s no need to slow down or deepen your breaths. Your breathing is amazing just the way it is.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might notice that your breathing changes from day to day. For example, sometimes it will be shallow and other times deeper. This is completely normal.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you notice your mind wandering off, gently bring your attention back to your breath.<br></p>

              <h2>Where should I meditate and how do I sit?</h2>
              <p>Meditation fits into any lifestyle. It can easily be a part of your daily life, no matter where you are: at home, at work, in a taxi, at the airport, in a coffee-shop, or maybe even in the bath.</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <h3>All you need to do is:</h3>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find a place where you can spend a few minutes undisturbed.<br>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find a comfortable position. You can sit on the floor or in a chair. You can even meditate lying down on your bed.<br>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Align your back so it’s as straight as possible, but don't strain or tense: comfort is key.<br>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't cross your arms or legs. Let your hands rest comfortably on your lap.<br>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s up to you whether to close your eyes or keep them open, but some people find meditating with closed eyes more effective.<br>
                  <br>
                  We know that sometimes it might be difficult to find a suitable place and posture, but don’t worry. With practice, you can easily meditate at a noisy party or in the middle of a parade. We'll explain how to deal with both the noise and your reaction to it. You’ll find that as your practice continues you can handle more and more external distractions.

              <h2>How can I achieve a state of meditative calmness?</h2>
              <h3>Distractions</h3>
              <p>When you’re just starting out, it's best to cut out as many distractions as possible:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Close the window so outdoor noises won’t disturb you.</li>
                <li>Turn off the radio, TV and any other sources of noise.</li>
                <li>Ask your homemates, friends, or colleagues not to disturb 	you during your meditation time.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <p><br>This will help you fully enjoy your experience and get the best possible results.<br>
                <br>
                While you’re meditating, pay attention to your inner distractions and let them come and go. Anything can wait for a few minutes. For example, if you hear a phone call during the meditation, let it ring; there’s no need to rush: you’ll call back later.
                </p>
                <h3>Clothing</h3>
                <p>
                  It isn't really important what you are wearing during meditation but it is better if you are comfortable in your clothes. So, when you’re just starting out, get yourself comfortable, cozy and warm. Relax your tie, unbutton the upper buttons of your shirt, take off your watch, and enjoy your practice.
                </p>
                <h3>The Space</h3>
                <p>Here are some suggestions to prepare your space for meditation:<br>
                  <br>
                  Dim or turn off the lights to help you concentrate.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add some small touches: a scented candle or a bouquet of flowers can completely change the feeling of a room.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a calm, loving pet nearby can enhance your meditative experience.</p>

              <div class="tip-more">
                <h3>Make Meditation a Habit</h3>
                <p>We recommend meditating every day at the same time and in the same place. Such consistency will help you form a habit.<br>
                Of course, we all know how difficult it is sometimes to find that extra 10 minutes each day.  With our modern busy lifestyles, we’ve all got too much to do and not enough free time.</p>
                <h3>Choose the Best Time for You</h3>
                <p>To find time for a consistent meditation practice, you’ll need to organize your schedule in a new way. Maybe you’ll find you prefer to start your day with a morning meditation, or maybe you’ll find that the best time for you is right before bed, as you’re preparing for a good night's sleep. Either way, carve out the same time each day to get the most out of your practice.</p>

              <h2>How do I find the time for meditation?</h2>
              <p>Let's imagine you had an extra 30 minutes every day.  Most likely, you’d have already filled up those minutes too, just like we do with the time we’ve got.  You need to convince yourself that carving out the time for meditation is worth it for you, and figure out a way to embed it into your daily schedule. </p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <h3>So, here are some tips that can help you find the time for meditation:</h3>
                <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all need alone time!  Take a look at meditation as some time that you can devote to yourself.  Meditation will help you get in touch with your own thoughts, emotions, and body.  You’ll find that after cultivating a meditation practice you get to know yourself better, something that’s never a waste of time!<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on your motivation! It’s easier to find time for you practice if you remember why you started in the first place.  Ask yourself how you want meditation to affect your life and what goals you’re trying to achieve.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start small! If you are a beginner, start with short meditations. Starting with 3-5 minute meditations is a great way to create a lasting habit. You need some time to get used to the process, so that later when you try out longer meditations they feel like a piece of cake.</p>

              <div class="tip-picture"><img src="includes/img/icons/h6.svg" alt=""></div>
              <h2>What if I get distracted?</h2>
              <p>During meditation, you might have noticed that you find it difficult to stay present.  Maybe you tend to get carried away by negative or repetitive thoughts, or maybe you can’t help but start making plans for the day ahead.  Perhaps you’re even wondering how much longer until the meditation is over...</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <p>Whatever is distracting you, it’s absolutely natural for your mind to wander off--we all experience it! Our minds are just not used to staying still. They work all the time, flitting from thought to thought and solving problems. During your practice, you’ll train your focus to notice this natural process.</p>
                <h3>How NOT to Handle Distraction:</h3>
                <p>We know that sometimes distractions are frustrating.  You might notice yourself caught up in a battle with your thoughts.  They start to carry you away, and you are struggling to push them down. Unfortunately this struggle is not helpful for bringing peace and harmony into your life.</p>
                <h3>How Can Meditation Help?</h3>
                <p>Meditation is not about trying to stop yourself from thinking. Rather, it’s about learning to accept your thoughts and distractions as they are. The important thing here is to become aware of when distraction occurs, and to gently bring your attention back to the present moment.<br>
                <br>
                Once you stop criticizing yourself for getting distracted and simply start to be aware of when your thoughts run free, you’ll notice that the inner chatter will actually start to quiet down on its own.  Noticing distractions is actually an exercise itself and is one of the keys to calming your mind.</p>

              <h2>What if I notice something unpleasant?</h2>
              <p>Mastering new skills can be challenging. Some days meditation will seem like a piece of cake, while on other days it will seem more like an impossible feat. Sometimes we might get overwhelmed by the emotions that bubble up during meditation, and we can even feel frightened of the new sensations.</p>
              <div class="tip-more">
                <p><br>For example, you might notice sadness, anger, pain, tiredness or even itchiness. Sometimes we don`t like the sensations we notice and our first reaction is to push them away and ignore them. But the more we try to push sensations or emotions away, the more insistently they spring back up.<br>
                <br>
                Whatever you notice while practicing, keep in mind that meditation is all about approaching our experiences with curiosity, openness, and acceptance, regardless of their desirability. It is absolutely normal to feel whatever you are feeling.  Allow all of your sensations and emotions to be present.  As you continue your practice, you’ll notice that accepting your emotions as they are will start to help you feel more calm and peaceful. </p>
